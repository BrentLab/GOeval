Description: This package provides functions to easily run gene set enrichment
              analysis on multiple subsets of a gene regulatory network as well
              as permuted versions of the network using the 'WebGestaltR' package.
              It also provides functions to help assess the quality of biological
              information captured by the network via metrics calculated from
              the enrichment results.
